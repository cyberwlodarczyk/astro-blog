<BaseLayout title="About me">
  <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>
  <p>
    I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page
    on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
  </p>
  <p>
    This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
    back and see how my journey is going!
  </p>
  <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My name is Łukasz Włodarczyk.</li>
    <li>I live in Poland.</li>
    {
      hobbies.length >= 2 && (
        <li>
          Two of my hobbies are: {hobbies[0]} and {hobbies[1]}.
        </li>
      )
    }
  </ul>
  <p>My skills are:</p>
  <ul>
    {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
  </ul>
  <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>
  <p>I've already finished this tutorial!</p>
